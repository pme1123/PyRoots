Command line scripts


Updated 07-31-2017



Scripts are for running pyroots on batches of images outside of the jupyter notebook. To use the scripts:

1. Send a copy of the batch script in the directory of the images you want to process

2. Send a copy of your parameters.py file into the same directory

3. Open your bash terminal (ex. ctrl+alt+T)

4. Navigate to your image directory

5. Type `python3 script_name.py`
    - ipython3 also works, and should be installed alongside the jupyter notebooks.
    - If you only have python 3 installed, then the command may be just `python script_name.py`. 

6. Follow the command prompts.
